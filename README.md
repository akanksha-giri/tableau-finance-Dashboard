and identify patterns in sales, discounts, and costs over time. 
The dashboard helps reveal trends in revenue, highlight areas of strength, and identify opportunities for improvement.

Data Sources:
The dashboard uses a structured financial dataset containing fields such as
Segment, Country, Product, Discount Band, Units Sold, Manufacturing Price, Sale Price,
Gross Sales, Discounts, Sales,COGS, Profit, and various Date attributes. 
These fields allow for multi-dimensional financial analysis across geography, product categories, and time periods.

Each visualization updates dynamically based on selected filters. 
This allows targeted exploration of financial performance, trends, and KPIs across different business dimensions.
